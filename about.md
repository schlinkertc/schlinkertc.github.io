### My name is Charlie. I'm a data scientist, former rock star, and a proud father.

I first became interested in data science when I was working in sales. I often found that the information I needed to perform my best was not available or inaccurate. To better manage my workload, I taught myself some basic SQL to auto-populate a google sheet with all of my sales leads and activities that refreshed regularly. I quickly hit the ceiling of what I could learn on my own. I decided to explore my interests further at Flatiron School's immersive data science program in NYC. 

At Flatiron, I studied Python and related frameworks like sklearn, Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, and Plotly. I greatly expanded my knowledge of SQL and gained experience with SQLAlchemy. I also studied the fundamentals of statistical decision making and applied them with Python. 

Since graduating in January, I've been honing my skills with various projects. You can find them on my [GitHub page](http://github.com/schlinkertc/), or you can learn more about me at my [personal website](humblechuck.com).
