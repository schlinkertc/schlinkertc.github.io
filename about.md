## About me

### My name is Charlie. I'm a data scientist, former rock star, and a proud father.

I’ve always been the kind of person to dedicate myself fully to the the things that inspire me. Growing up, that manifested in my passion for music. I practiced for hours every day, and I was rewarded with an exciting career as a drummer and recording artist. 

When I learned that I was to be a father, my priorities shifted. That’s what inspired me to pursue a business degree the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University. After graduating, I took a job in sales. Although I was successful in my sales role, I wasn’t passionate about the work. 

To satisfy my drive to learn and develop new skills, I became fascinated with the underlying data structure of my department. I started to teach myself SQL, but I quickly hit the ceiling of what I could achieve in my spare time. So I decided to press the reset button (again) and study data science at Flatiron School in Manhattan. 

I’ve since fell in love with all things related to python programming, statistics, and data engineering. I’ve come a long way, but I’m still determined to learn everyday. I’m looking forward to kick-starting my data science career, and I’m currently looking for my first full time job in the field.
